So, itÕs your diaphragm, the main muscle of breathing, that is in charge when you are holding your breath. But, in the end, even if youÕve fooled it for a while, the signals from the diaphragm become too strong and you have to give up Ð and take a breath.",0,"While our ability to breath-hold may not be special, when we compare ourselves with other animals, itÕs now becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine. Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation, very precisely, at the tumour. This may require several minutes of radiation and, so, itÕs usually done in short periods, between breaths. But, if the patient can keep her chest perfectlystill for several minutes, it means that the entire dose can be given, in the right place, in one go. The problem, of course, is that most people, just like me, cannot hold their breath for much longer than a minute. But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have shown that, if patients are given oxygen-rich air before holding their breath, they can hold it for  ve-and-a-half minutes.",1
"Surprisingly, the trick seems to lie not in foolingthe bodyÕs usual sensors for low oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels in the blood but in fooling the diaphragm. When you breathe in, youÕre contracting the muscle of your diaphragm, pulling it  at so that the volume of your chest increases Ð and air is drawn into your lungs. When you hold your breath, you keep your diaphragm in this contracted state. Arti cially raising oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide levels before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, may work by delaying fatigue in the diaphragm. And Ð not so useful if youÕre trying to keep your chest perfectly still Ð breathing out a little air lets the diaphragm relax a little, and helps you to prolong a breath-hold, exactly as I found when attempting my breath-hold. And, so, itÕs your diaphragm, the main muscle of breathing, that is also in charge when it comes to reaching the breakpoint of your breath-hold. Eventually, even if youÕve fooled it for a while, the signals from the diaphragm are just too strong and you have to give in Ð and take a breath.",2,"Surprisingly, the trick seems to be the ability tofool the diaphragm.

Most people like music but donÕt love it enough to pay $120 a year to listen to it. On average, people in the UK, for example, spent just £39.52 on music in 2014. Even Apple will  nd it very dif cult to make people triple the money they spend on recorded music.",0,"Is this the end of downloading?The iTunes Store arrived in 2003 (2004 in Europe) at a time when piracy was widespread. Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business withan estimated 70% market share. Downloads were still 52% of the total digital income in 2014, according to IFPI. Apple holds the lionÕs shareof this Ð it is biggest music retailer in the world. But download revenue reached a peak in 2013in the UK at £283m and fell to £249m in 2014. The decline in download sales hit the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for $3bn in order to get into the premium headphone market and, also, to make the transition from music ownership (downloads) to music access (subscription streaming). Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market justyet Ð so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand. The vast majority of people like music but donÕt love it enough to pay $120 a year to listen to it. The average spend of a music buyer in the UK in 2014, for example, was just £39.52. Even Apple will  nd it very dif cult to make most of those people triple their annual spend on recorded music.",1

"Where are the artist exclusives?This is going to be the interesting bit when the service actually goes live. Getting exclusivesfor big albums is going to become crucial to streaming.

more than half of all transactions are made with
paper money and coins. The former president
of Germany’s constitutional court, Hans-Jürgen
Papier, told Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung that restrictions on cash were at odds with
individual freedom, while tabloid newspaper Bild
has launched a petition in defence of paper money,
including the €500 note – “hands off my cash”.",2,"Europol would like to see central banks take
more responsibility for what happens with €500
notes. Luxembourg, for example, issued more
than twice its annual GDP in banknotes in 2013
alone. Europol asked Luxembourg’s central bank
to explain. The reply from Luxembourg was that
they simply issue the notes that are asked for
and do not ask or know why people want them,
said Jennifer MacLeod, a specialist in Europol’s
financial intelligence group. “I find it surprising that
a central bank does not consider itself to have a
responsibility in this area.”",1
"Law enforcement authorities are less convinced,
amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious
bundles of cash. In one case that has caught
the attention of police, two men walked into a
bank and tried to deposit €200,000 of torn and
muddy €500 notes. In the same week, €1.3m in €500 notes was found stuffed in the false bottom
of suitcase. But, a suspicion of criminality is not
enough to keep people in custody. “Our frustration
from a law enforcement perspective is that, in
many jurisdictions, it is impossible to provide
sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities
of a link between suspicious cash detections and
criminality,” says Jennifer MacLeod, a specialist in
Europol’s financial intelligence group. “The search
for these links is complicated further through
time constraints and fragmented cooperation and
information exchange.”",2,"This could be changing. EU finance ministers
have asked policymakers to think about
“appropriate limits” on high-value notes and report
back by 1 May 2016.",1

"To make anything cool requires what engineers call a heat sink: somewhere to dump unwanted heat. The heat sink has to be cooler than the object that needs cooling or it will not do its job. For example, a bucket of ice will cool a bottle of wine because it becomes a sink for heat in the liquid.

her enemies – including moderate members of
her own party.",2,"As the British economy recovered from the very bad
recession that her policies had caused, she seemed
invincible for a short time. But unlimited power and
the defeat or retirement of allies led to mistakes and
increasing unpopularity. When her deputy finally fell
out with her – mainly on the subject of Europe – his
damaging resignation speech led to a leadership
challenge. After a vote among Conservative MPs
failed to support her, John Major took control of
the party.",1

“handbaggings”, or verbal attacks, in the
European Union to obtain a British rebate – “my
money” as she called it. She was less successful
in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the
“Belgian Empire”, her description of the European
Commission, especially in the years when it was
headed by the French socialist Jacques Delors.",2,"After she retired, she wrote highly successful memoirs

who are relative newcomers to the franchise, and it
also managed to engage the older, more nostalgic
elements of the audience, who may have lost
interest over the previous few films. With the new

hang on to the nostalgic, more age-diverse Bond
