"Cerf called for the development of Âdigital vellumÂ
to preserve old software and hardware so that
out-of-date files could be recovered no matter how
old they are. ÂWhen you think about the quantity of
documentation from our daily lives that is captured
in digital form, like our interactions by email,
peopleÂs tweets and all of the world wide web,
itÂs clear that we stand to lose an awful lot of our
history,Â he said. ÂWe donÂt want our digital lives to
fade away. If we want to preserve them, we need to
make sure that the digital objects we create today
can still be rendered far into the future,Â he added.",2,"Cerf said we should develop digital methods to
preserve old software and hardware to read old
