"West suggested that politicians should see e-cigarettes as something that helps people stop smoking. He doesnÕt think they should follow the same laws as smoking. ÒSome local authorities and organizations treat e-cigarettes like cigarettes Ð they ban them in public places and outdoors,Ó he said. He thinks we should support vapers not attack them.",0,"Hazel Cheeseman, director of policy at ASH, said it was too soon to say whether vaping had peaked. ÒAlthough there are indications that the market hasnÕt grown in the UK for about a year, there doesnÕt seem to be a decline in the number of people using electronic cigarettes to help them quit smoking.Ó",1
"It emerged recently that the European Commission (EC) is looking at increasing taxes on e-cigarettes, something that could have an impact on their popularity. A new EC tobacco directive comes into force in 2016 that will limit the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes to below their current levels. This may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to obtain the same hit, again something that may make e-cigarettes more expensive.",2,"The European Commission (EC) is looking at increasing taxes on e-cigarettes, which could have an impact on their popularity.

"West suggested that policymakers should see e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid andnot subject them to the same regulations as smoking. ÒThere is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors,Ó he said. ÒThe problem is that brings public health into disrepute. It just sounds like youÕre having a go at vapers and hitting everyone with a sledgehammer and that underminesthe public health messages weÕre trying to get out. We have to be careful not tostigmatize e-cigarettes.Ó",2,"West suggested that policymakers should see e-cigarettes as an aid to stopping smoking and not have the same regulations for them as for smoking.
